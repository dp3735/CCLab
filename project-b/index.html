        <h1>A brief overview</h1>
        <p>Humans are born with a limited number of neurons, which is a special cell in the nervous system that can send
            information through electrical and chemical signals in the brain.
            Even though the number of neurons in our brain is important, the connections between them are the most
            crucial. Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain's physiology to change over time. Neuroplasticity
            occurs at the beginning of life when the new brain organizes itself. This change can happen throughout
            adulthood like when we are learning something new. As we learn new skills the connections between the
            neurons (dendritic branches) develop and grow along with us. The conception and “communication paths” are
            referred to as neural networks or synapses. When we work these connections, they stronger they become, which
            allows us brain to intake information better.

        The brain is naturally divided into many different parts. There are 2 hemisphere, the right and the left. Then
        there
        are also 4 main lobes- the occipital, parietal, frontal and temporal lobe. Certain brain regions are the genesis
        of
        particular behaviors, cognitions, and emotions. Each lobe has it's own function, look at the diagram on the
        right to see which lobe controls what function of humans exactly. </div>
